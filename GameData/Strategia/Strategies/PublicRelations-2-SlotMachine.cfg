    desc = These agencies seem to think they're doing us a favour offering by us these ridiculous contracts.  Why should we be penalized for being choosy?  By closing our books to the public, agencies will have no idea what we're willing to accept.  There might be a little chaos in the contracts we see under this model, but if we're only choosing the best ones, then who cares?!?
